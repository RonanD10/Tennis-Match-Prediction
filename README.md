ATP Tennis machine learning project using tennis domain knowledge for informed feature engineering. 

1) Elo calulation as powerful feature for determining player strength

2) Analysis of all-time Elos and all-time records, such as career length

3) Feature engineering and preprocessing

4) Model selection -- logistic regression / random forest regression / neural network. Analysis of model accuracies, coefficients, PCA

**Best model: 79% accuracy**
